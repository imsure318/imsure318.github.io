I work as a senior research scientist in the AI group of Bloomberg, London, UK. Before then, 
I obtained my doctoral degree at the University of Stavanger, Norway, in 2019, under the supervision of Prof. [Krisztian Balog](http://krisztianbalog.com/). 
I used to be a visiting scholar at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA, in 2019, visiting Prof. [Jamie Callan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~callan/). 
My main research interests include information retrieval and text mining. My Ph.D. research is concerned with developing intelligent search technology for tabular data.
<!--Before Ph.D., I obtained two master's degrees in Computer Science and Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Stavanger and Nanjing Unversity of Posts and Telecommunications, China, respectively.-->
